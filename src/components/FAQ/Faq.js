                  As a supplier, you make money when any of the products you
                  listed gets sold. If the product is from your business you get
                  paid the full price but for other businesses you get paid a
                  percent of the price.
                </p>
                <p>
                  As a reseller, you make money when a customer buys from your
                  store. You get the markup you added to the original price of
                  the product after transaction fees are deducted.
